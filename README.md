# College Listing with Search, Filter, and Infinite Scroll

This project is a dynamic college listing table built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a list of colleges with features like infinite scrolling, searching by college name, and filtering by fees and user ratings.

## Features

- **Infinite Scroll**: The table initially loads a limited number of rows. As the user scrolls down, more rows are dynamically loaded to ensure a smooth and performant user experience.
- **Search by College Name**: Users can search for colleges by typing the name in a search bar. The table will automatically filter to display only the matching results.
- **Filter by Fees and Ratings**: Users can filter colleges based on maximum course fees and minimum user ratings using dropdowns. The table updates in real-time based on the selected filters.
- **Dynamic Table Rendering**: The table rows are dynamically generated based on a JavaScript array of college data. This allows for easy updates and modifications to the displayed content.
